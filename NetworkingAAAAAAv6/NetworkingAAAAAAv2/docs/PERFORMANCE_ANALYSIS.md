# Performance Analysis Report - Multi-User Chat System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document presents the performance analysis of the Multi-User Chat System. The goal is to evaluate the system's behavior under various conditions, focusing on key performance metrics for both its TCP and UDP implementations.

### 1.2. Scope
The analysis covers:
*   Message latency.
*   Message throughput.
*   Server resource utilization (CPU, Memory).
*   Scalability with an increasing number of clients.
*   Impact of UDP reliability mechanisms.

### 1.3. System Overview
Briefly reiterate the client-server architecture, TCP/UDP modes, and custom protocol. (Reference `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` for full details).

## 2. Testing Methodology

### 2.1. Test Environment
*   **Hardware Specifications:**
    *   Server Machine: (e.g., CPU, RAM, Network Interface)
    *   Client Machine(s): (e.g., CPU, RAM, Network Interface). Specify if multiple physical or virtual machines are used.
*   **Software Specifications:**
    *   Operating System(s): (e.g., Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04) for server and clients.
    *   Python Version: (e.g., Python 3.9.x)
    *   Key Libraries: (Mention standard libraries like `socket`, `tkinter`, `json`, `threading`)
*   **Network Configuration:**
    *   Local Network (LAN): Specify if tests are run on a LAN. (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
    *   Simulated WAN conditions (if applicable): Mention any tools used to simulate latency, packet loss (e.g., `tc` on Linux, WAN emulators). This is particularly relevant for UDP tests.

### 2.2. Test Scenarios
Define specific scenarios to test:

*   **Scenario A: TCP Mode**
    *   A.1: Low load (e.g., 2-5 clients, low message rate).
    *   A.2: Medium load (e.g., 10-20 clients, moderate message rate).
    *   A.3: High load (e.g., 30-50+ clients, high message rate - stress test).
*   **Scenario B: UDP Mode (with reliability)**
    *   B.1: Low load (e.g., 2-5 clients, low message rate, ideal network).
    *   B.2: Medium load (e.g., 10-20 clients, moderate message rate, ideal network).
    *   B.3: High load (e.g., 30-50+ clients, high message rate, ideal network).
    *   B.4: UDP with Packet Loss (e.g., 5-10 clients, moderate rate, simulated 1-5% packet loss).
    *   B.5: UDP with Latency (e.g., 5-10 clients, moderate rate, simulated 50-100ms additional RTT).
*   **Message Characteristics:**
    *   Average message size (e.g., 50-100 bytes).
    *   Message sending rate per client (e.g., 1 message/sec, 5 messages/sec).

### 2.3. Performance Metrics
*   **End-to-End Message Latency:**
    *   Definition: Time taken for a message sent by one client to be received by another client.
    *   Measurement: Timestamping at the sender client just before sending, and at the receiver client upon message display. Calculate the delta. Average, 95th percentile, max.
*   **Server-Side Processing Time (Optional but good):**
    *   Definition: Time server takes to receive a message, process it (e.g., identify recipients), and forward/broadcast it.
    *   Measurement: Timestamps within server logic.
*   **Throughput:**
    *   Definition: Number of messages successfully processed and delivered by the system per unit of time (e.g., messages/second).
    *   Measurement: Count total messages sent and received by all clients over a fixed duration.
*   **Server Resource Utilization:**
    *   CPU Usage (%): Measured using system monitoring tools (e.g., Task Manager, `top`, `htop`).
    *   Memory Usage (MB): Measured using system monitoring tools.
*   **Scalability:**
    *   How the above metrics (latency, throughput, resource use) change as the number of concurrent clients increases.
*   **UDP Reliability Overhead:**
    *   Retransmission Rate (%): Number of retransmitted UDP packets / Total UDP data packets sent.
    *   Impact of ACKs on throughput/latency compared to a hypothetical non-reliable UDP.

### 2.4. Data Collection Tools & Techniques
*   **Client-side logging:** For timestamps and message counts.
*   **Server-side logging:** For timestamps, message counts, errors, retransmissions.
*   **System Monitoring Tools:** (e.g., `psutil` library in Python for programmatic access, or OS-native tools).
*   **Scripting:** Python scripts to automate client connections, message sending, and log parsing.
*   **Network Emulation Tools:** (e.g., `netem` with `tc` on Linux, Clumsy on Windows, or similar).

## 3. Test Results and Analysis

For each test scenario (A.1, A.2, ..., B.5):

### 3.x. [Scenario Name, e.g., TCP - Medium Load]
*   **Observations:** Qualitative notes on system behavior.
*   **Quantitative Results:**
    *   Latency (Avg, P95, Max): Table/Graph.
    *   Throughput (Msgs/sec): Value.
    *   Server CPU Usage (% Avg, Peak): Table/Graph.
    *   Server Memory Usage (MB Avg, Peak): Table/Graph.
    *   (For UDP) Retransmission Rate: Value.
*   **Analysis:** Discuss the results. Why were they as observed? Any bottlenecks? How did it compare to other loads?

## 4. Comparative Analysis (Optional)

*   **TCP vs. UDP (with reliability):**
    *   Compare latency, throughput, and server load under similar conditions.
    *   Discuss the trade-offs observed (e.g., UDP reliability overhead vs. TCP's built-in mechanisms).
*   **Comparison with Theoretical Expectations/Existing Solutions:**
    *   Briefly discuss if performance aligns with what might be expected from similar small-scale chat systems. (This is often high-level unless specific benchmarks exist).

## 5. Performance Limitations and Trade-offs

*   Identify known limitations of the current implementation (e.g., UDP out-of-order handling, scalability of single-threaded UDP receive loop on server).
*   Discuss design trade-offs made (e.g., simplicity of Tkinter vs. performance of other GUI frameworks, basic UDP reliability vs. full TCP-like features).

## 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

*   Summarize key performance findings.
*   Suggest potential areas for performance improvement based on the analysis (tying back to "Potential Future Enhancements" in `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`).

## Appendix (Optional)

*   Raw data tables.
*   Specific scripts used for testing.
*   Detailed graphs.

This outline provides a comprehensive structure. You'll need to:
1.  **Set up your test environment.**
2.  **Develop simple test scripts** (or manually coordinate) to simulate client behavior (connecting, sending messages at certain rates). Your existing client code can be a base for this, perhaps with a mode to auto-send messages.
3.  **Add more detailed logging** to your client and server code to capture timestamps and relevant events for metric calculation.
4.  **Run the tests** systematically for each scenario.
5.  **Collect and analyze the data.**
6.  **Write the report** based on this template.

This is a significant task in itself. Good luck!
